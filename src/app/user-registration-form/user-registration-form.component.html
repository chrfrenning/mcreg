      <h3>Players' Code of Conduct</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>The server is not generally restricted, but this means that you need to ensure you aren’t breaking anyone else’s structure when doing your own demolition or building work. Look around and make sure no one else has claimed the area before building. Before building yourself, you should claim an area with a fence or something similar, and register it for the build competition (if applicable) or place a sign saying who has claimed it.</li>
        <li>Don’t claim too large of an area. The world is big, so don’t feel bad about claiming as big of an area as is reasonable, but you can’t claim half the map. Use common sense. </li>
        <li>Make sure your claimed plot is obvious. If you are claiming below ground, make that obvious as well. </li>
        <li>The minigames are not restricted or otherwise judged. Players are expected to coordinate themselves when playing minigames. Don’t disrupt people who are playing, but also take turns and share the arenas. </li>
        <li>The server is open to both Microsofties and their families, including kids. Watch your language, and keep in mind that kids will see your messages and game chat. </li>
        <li>Don’t use hacks or other exploits that negatively affect the server or other people’s game play. Don’t spam commands. </li>
        <li>Feel free to create complex machines using redstone or other in game mechanisms, but do be aware that if the contraption is causing server wide lag, it may be removed or disabled. Do not create unrestricted redstone fliers or other devices that can’t be contained. </li>
        <li>Other than in the PVP arena, PVP is not allowed. Do not attempt to indirectly circumvent this goal.  </li>
        <li>Use common courtesy when playing. We’re here to have fun! </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Data Storage Terms</h3>
      <p>We will store your Minecraft profile name(s) and Microsoft alias on our Minecraft server for the duration of the event.</p>
